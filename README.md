Code for the analysis done in the published paper 'Linking Science and Literacy Through Multimodal Text Sets: Student Perspectives' https://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1932&amp;context=biology

The 'Exit_slip.csv' consists of responses by middle school students within the 'learned' and 'Confused about' column about multimodal STEM text sets.

The code can be used to preprocess the text within these columns and generate topics discovered within these columns along with the word clouds for each topic.
